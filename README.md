# Atm-Emulator (simple)
This project has been developed for a first term project on C language
Development process took some hours and contains a very simple ATM emulator based in C
Programm defines a pin (1234) and the available amount of money 
User has 3 tries to enter the correct pin or process is being terminated (in every wrong input program displays the remaining tries)
After user is being authenticated 3 options are displayed and the user can deposit/add or see the available money on account
After a deposit/add the program says the new available ammount!
